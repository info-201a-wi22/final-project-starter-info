## Abstract
- main question: how much of an impact do vaccines create on public health in the U.S.?
  - this question is important because “getting vaccinated lowers the risk of getting/spreading the virus, prevent serious illness and death, and teaches your immune system to create an antibody response” (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html#:~:text=Getting%20vaccinated%20against%20COVID%2D,5%20years%20and%20older.))
- vaccines help protect those who can’t get vaccinated, are immunocompromised, or are at higher risk
- compare covid cases with vaccine rates, can also introduce other vaccines as well (if needed)
- address concerns of anti-vaxxers
  - ex: theory that typhoid vaccine causes school shootings, [read more here](https://vaccineimpact.com/2018/new-study-vaccines-linked-to-decline-in-mental-health-and-social-interaction-cause-of-increase-in-mass-school-shootings/) (it’s comical, really)
- purpose is to bring awareness about why you should get vaccinated
- [it costs $0 to get vaccinated](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/learn-more-about-covid-19-vaccines-fda#:~:text=FDA%2Dauthorized%20COVID%2D,or%20after%20your%20appointment.)


## Keywords
Vaccinations, spread prevention, public health, mortality rate,

## 1.0 Introduction
Project Vax describes the impact of vaccinations on public health through datasets gathered from (datasets).

## 2.0 Design Situation
Project framing:
Human values:
Direct stakeholders: the public, anti-vaxers
Indirect stakeholders:
Possible harms/benefits: bring awareness, help people do their part

## 3.0 Research Questions

## 4.0 The Dataset
The dataset we have chosen to use for our project _The Impact of Vaccines_, compares the [covid-19 vaccination rate vs the mortality rate across the world] (https://www.kaggle.com/sinakaraji/covid-vaccination-vs-death). It observes the outbreak that we have all witnessed and looks at the positives around the vaccination that has surfaced. The reason why this dataset was generated was to investigate the impact of the coronavirus vaccine on the covid-19 mortality. This data file exceeds the amount of 200 observations and is a combination of a total of 3 different datasets. It represents a majority of each country around the world and keeps track of their total vaccinations, number of people vaccinated, people fully vaccinated, new deaths, the population count, and the ratio. The data was collected by Sina Karaji and it was updated last about a month ago meaning that it is up to date, the reason why he created the dataset was because he noticed how many deaths have been caused since the outbreak of the coronavirus, so he wanted to look at the impact that the vaccination has had. By doing this he is able to show people the positive impact of the vaccination and persuade the rest of the world to get vaccinated. Those who are likely to be benefited from the data could be companies such as the CDC who are looking to view datasets that could help them combat the virus, but this could also interest people who are trying to convince anti-vaxxers that vaccinations are helpful and the public who wants to see the positive effect that the vaccine has had.

## 5.0 Expected Implications
Our group expects that policymakers and world leaders will utilize the data presented by **Project Vax** enact laws ensuring their citizens are provided with enough vaccinations to reach _herd immunity_  (when a large portion of the population becomes immune to a disease, it makes the spread of the disease from one individual to another very unlikely. As a result, the whole community is protected. This can be done through using the financial resources and size of their national governments to purchase vaccines in bulk quantities and at a reduced price. Policymakers must also ensure that their vaccines are accessible to their citizens, directionally and financially. We also expect **Project Vax** will be utilized as an educational aid to convince those who do not believe in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. 

## 6.0 Limitations
- information is only tracked/recorded if it is given
- the number of vaccinated people is impacted by more than anti-vaxxers:
  - generally speaking:
    - religious exemption or severe allergies to vaccine ingredients (i.e. medical exemption) (via [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/essentialworker/workplace-vaccination-program.html))
    - list of who shouldn’t take certain vaccines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html)
  - covid is safe for people with [underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html?s_cid=10485:who%20should%20not%20take%20the%20covid%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21)
- missing values or inconsistencies in the data used
