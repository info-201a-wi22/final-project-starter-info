## Abstract
- main question: how much of an impact do vaccines create on public health in the U.S.?
  - this question is important because “getting vaccinated lowers the risk of getting/spreading the virus, prevent serious illness and death, and teaches your immune system to create an antibody response” (via [CDC]("https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html#:~:text=Getting%20vaccinated%20against%20COVID%2D,5%20years%20and%20older."))
- vaccines help protect those who can’t get vaccinated, are immunocompromised, or are at higher risk
- compare covid cases with vaccine rates, can also introduce other vaccines as well (if needed)
- address concerns of anti-vaxxers
  - ex: theory that typhoid vaccine causes school shootings, [read more here]("https://vaccineimpact.com/2018/new-study-vaccines-linked-to-decline-in-mental-health-and-social-interaction-cause-of-increase-in-mass-school-shootings/") (it’s comical, really)
- purpose is to bring awareness about why you should get vaccinated
- [it costs $0 to get vaccinated]("https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/learn-more-about-covid-19-vaccines-fda#:~:text=FDA%2Dauthorized%20COVID%2D,or%20after%20your%20appointment.")


## Keywords
Vaccinations, spread prevention, public health, mortality rate,

## 1.0 Introduction
Project Vax describes the impact of vaccinations on public health through datasets gathered from (datasets).

## 2.0 Design Situation
Project framing:
Human values:
Direct stakeholders: the public, anti-vaxers
Indirect stakeholders:
Possible harms/benefits: bring awareness, help people do their part

## 3.0 Research Questions

## 4.0 The Dataset

## 5.0 Expected Implications

## 6.0 Limitations
- information is only tracked/recorded if it is given
- the number of vaccinated people is impacted by more than anti-vaxxers:
  - generally speaking:
    - religious exemption or severe allergies to vaccine ingredients (i.e. medical exemption) (via [CDC]("https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/essentialworker/workplace-vaccination-program.html"))
    - list of who shouldn’t take certain vaccines [here]("https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html")
  - covid is safe for people with [underlying medical conditions]("https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html?s_cid=10485:who%20should%20not%20take%20the%20covid%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21")
- missing values or inconsistencies in the data used
