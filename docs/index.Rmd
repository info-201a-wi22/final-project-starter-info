### Abstract
Our main question is how vaccines can create an impact on public health in the U.S. This question is important because vaccinations can lower an individual’s risk 
for getting or spreading the virus, prevent severe symptoms, illness, and death, and initiates an antibody response in the immune system. To address the question, 
we will compare vaccination rates to the mortality rate and the total number of cases.

### Keywords
Vaccinations, spread prevention, public health, and mortality rate.

### 1.0 Introduction
The dataset(s) we are analyzing shows us the rate of vaccinations across the United States and the infection/mortality rate among those vaccinated and unvaccinated 
due to COVID-19. Our group is interested in exploring the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and how the data either supports or opposes the current iterations 
of the COVID-19 vaccines in the fight against the virus and its variants. The outbreak of the Coronavirus vaccine has greatly disrupted modern life the past few 
years and these vaccines can be the key to normality within the near future.

### 2.0 Design Situation
Our group’s topic of concern revolves around the COVID-19 and its relationship between vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and how vaccinations have a role to play 
in the mortality rate which has been surging since the pandemic has started. The concern among getting everyone vaccinated stems from the human values of mutual 
empathy and the love for your common man. We want everyone to stay healthy and alive. There is also the selfish concern of getting life back to normal, before the 
global pandemic and the restrictions that came with it. The goal of vaccines is to reach herd immunity. In order to protect those vulnerable and unable to be 
vaccinated, we strive to get every abled body vaccinated. In order to protect those vulnerable and unable to be vaccinated, we strive to get every abled body 
vaccinated. The direct stakeholders, those who will directly interact with **Project Vax**, are political leaders and policymakers, whether local or federal, who 
can explain the effectiveness of vaccines. The indirect stakeholders are those who did not directly interact with the project firsthand but can feel the effects
from those who did. Indirect stakeholders may include the general public who are subject to laws and regulations placed upon them by policy makers and government 
officials who have directly interacted with **Project Vax**. They may also include individuals who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and unable to vaccinate 
themselves due to preexisting conditions or individuals who refuse to be vaccinated and are being educated by those who are.  Lastly, these may include essential
workers who are subject to regulations that may require them to be vaccinated or risk losing their jobs. Essential workers are put at risk of exposure and close 
contact in their jobs everyday, and are in even more danger if the individuals they interact with are not doing their part to be cautious. The harms of **Project 
Vax**  are the limitations of the existing data and its accuracy, the information can be biased to service political motivations that are promptly against 
vaccines. However, the benefits of our project heavily outweigh the harms. With the information present in **Project Vax**; national, state and local governments 
are better able to assess the situation of the global pandemic and enact policies and regulations accordingly. The hope is for representatives in the United 
States’ lowest vaccinated states to enact change as deaths from the virus are highest among low vaccinated states (NBCNews, 2022). This can also include the
expansion of free or affordable COVID-19 vaccines that are made accessible to the general public.

### 3.0 Research Questions
Our teams questions: 
- How much of an impact do vaccines create on public health in the U.S.?
- Have vaccinations helped the mortality rate of COVID-19 go down?
- Are a majority of the population in countries fully vaxxed?
- As the amount of new deaths were rising, were more people willing to get vaccinated?

These questions are important because they are focused and aimed to find the positives that come with becoming vaccinated in order to prevent COVID-19’s death toll 
from continuing to go up. With these questions, we want to be able to find the positives of being vaccinated and prove that it is something that could eventually 
take down the virus. We also would like to shed light on how the vaccination actually works and could prevent death, doing this we could potentially motivate 
people to go get vaccinated in order to combat the virus. We will address these questions by using our [dataset on vaccination vs death]
(https://www.kaggle.com/sinakaraji/covid-vaccination-vs-death) . By doing so we could look at all countries across the globe and view content such as how many 
people have been fully vaccinated and the ratio comparing the total population to the number of people who have got vaccinated.

### 4.0 Data Set

### 5.0 Expected Implications
Our group expects that local, state, and federal policymakers will gain a greater understanding of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines from our project “The 
Impact of Vaccines”. The goal of our project is to inspire those will the power and influence to change policy/ enact laws that will ensure their citizens have 
access to free or affordable vaccines in order to reach herd immunity (which is when a large portion of the population becomes immune to a disease, it makes the 
spread of the disease from one individual to another very unlikely. As a result, the whole community is protected). This can be done through utilizing the large 
size of government to acquire vaccines in bulk quantities at a low cost. Governments can also utilize data science to strategically move vaccines to cities and 
states where demand and need are greatest. Not only do vaccines have to be financially accessible to everyone but it should be easy to find a vaccination site 
locally and schedule an appointment with ease. We also expect **Project Vax** will be used as an educational tool to convince those who are resistant to receiving 
a vaccine or those who do not believe in the effectiveness of vaccines.

### 6.0 Limitations
Our group acknowledges that there are certain limitations to this research project, such as 
access to the most current and accurate information. Because of the scale of our research project, we are limited to data provided by third party researchers who 
publish their records online. Moreover, the research from these studies may not be inclusive of all demographics in an entire population;  in order to classify 
that an individual has been vaccinated or tested positive for COVID-19, they had to have access to a testing site and proper healthcare provisions. In the United 
States, there are certain demographics in our population (especially low-income communities of color) that do not have access to proper provisions, which means 
that the data we find on the internet won’t include individuals in those communities. There are additional factors such as the vaccine manufacturer, whether it is
Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson or the different strains of COVID-19 (Delta, Omicron). Our research project also classifies a vaccinated individual as anyone 
who received at least one dose of the vaccine. These factors may influence the infection and mortality rate of our research project. We must also take account of 
factors that contribute to the number of vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals in a population, such as medical exemptions due to allergies; however, the CDC has 
explicitly stated that for those with underlying medical conditions, the COVID-19 vaccination is safe to receive.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!
