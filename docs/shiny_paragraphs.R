int2_helptext <- "Explore numbers of the general population in the U.S. Here, you can check numbers
of various vaccination statuses, such as \"Single Dosed\", \"Fully Vaccinated\", and \"Boosted\". 
Individuals under the category of single dosed are those who have at least one dose of the vaccine. 
Numbers under the fully vaccinated category report the total consensus of people who have completed 
the full series of their vaccination brand (either a two-dose series or one-dose series). The 
booster category shows those who have been fully vaccinated and have also recieved an additional 
(booster) shot."

int2_description <- "Sourced from the CDC, these numbers are recorded either from Pfizer, Moderna, 
Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, or another manufacturer of the COVID-19 vaccination. \"Data represents 
all vaccine partners including jurisdictional partner clinics, retail pharmacies, long-term care 
facilities, dialysis centers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and 
Services Administration partner sites, and federal entity facilities\" (via CDC website). The 
specific columns selected for this analysis are based on the jurisdiction (state) where recipients 
live."
